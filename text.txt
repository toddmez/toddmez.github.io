The principles of animation, like squash and {stretch} or anticipation, are the soul of bringing life to motion. They’re not just rules but universal truths about how objects behave and {emotions} are communicated. Think about slow in and slow out—it’s not {just} about easing into action but mimicking the way {energy} builds and fades in real life. Each {principle} connects motion to meaning, transforming drawings or {models} into characters that feel alive. Without them, movement is just mechanics. With them, it’s storytelling. Animation becomes less about what we {see} and more about what we {feel} through {what} we see.
